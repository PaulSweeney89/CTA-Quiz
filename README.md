# CTA-Quiz
Repository containing code for Computational Thinking with Algorithms Quizzes

## Week 1 - Practice Quiz

1. Write a function which takes in two numbers and adds them together.

``def add(num1, num2):``

2.  Write a function which takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the even numbers from the first array.

``def only_evens(arr):``

3. Write a function which takes in a string and replaces all occurrences of 'e' with '*' and returns the resulting string.

``def replace_char(string):``

## Week 2 - Practice

1. Write a program that asks the user for a number, n then asks if they want to compute the sum or product of 1...n.

## Week 3 - Homework

1. Write an algorithm that returns the largest element in an array. Assume the array is
unsorted.

2. Write an algorithm that returns a new array which is the reverse of the input.

3. Write an algorithm that checks whether an element occurs in an array.

4. Write an algorithm that returns the elements on odd positions in an array.

5. Write an algorithm that computes the running total of an array of numbers.

6. Write an algorithm that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.

7. Write an algorithm that prints the first 100 prime numbers.

8. Write an algorithm that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of ’3’ print
“Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of ’5’ print “Buzz”.

## Week 8 - Homework (Recursion Algorithms)

1. Write an algorithm that returns the reverse of a given string.

2. Write an algorithm that reverses an array in-place (i.e changes what is stored at each
index), assume the input array contains numbers.

3. Write an algorithm that checks whether an element occurs in an array, assume unsorted.

4. Write an algorithm that computes the sum of an array of numbers.

5. Write an algorithm to produce calculate the Nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
Assume the sequence begins 0,1,1,2....

6. Write a recursive function that checks whether a string is a palindrome (a palindrome
is a string that’s the same when reads forwards and backwards.)

7. Given a number and a power, compute the result of the number raised to that power.
For example 23 = 8.

8. Given a string and a substring, compute how many times that substring appears in
the string. For example “he” appears twice in the string “her and herself”.
